# My Portfolio Website

I started my career as a communications professional in 2014. In 2020, I decided to take a different turn after a few years of growing interest for digital interfaces, UX design, coding and all-things web.👩‍💻

So here I am in March 2021 building my online portfolio to share my path and the projects I have been a part to. How exciting!

## What it is made with 🎨🧙‍♀️

This portfolio is a simple static website made with HTML5, CSS3 and a bit of ES6. I deployed it using GitHub Pages. For images like logos and screen extracts, I used Figma.

### The sections

- Homepage with two calls to action
- Work page with card layout for each project
- About page with a vertical timeline and cards to emphasize my strengths
- Project pages with some tags, grids to display screen views of the projects

All fully responsive to diverse screen sizes.📱
