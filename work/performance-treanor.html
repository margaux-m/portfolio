        Performance Treanor is a health and wellness coach and presenter. In early 2020, he
        embarked on a new business journey adding new services to his offering: corporate
        workshops and a peak performance online course, on top of personal training and weight
        loss programmes.

      <h3>What I helped with</h3>
      <p>
        My primary focus was to help launch the online course and redesign the existing website.
        I also brought in growth advice and my experience as a communications professional.
      </p>
      <p>
        I implemented a new website reflecting the new offering. The client chose Kajabi as it
        enables him now to be fully autonomous in updating the website and the online course, and
        sending email marketing campaigns.
      </p>
      <p>
        I changed the overall branding, designed new visuals for the website and created diverse
        communication material (images for social media, video teasers, new layout for the monthly
        newsletter, pitch presentations for B2B clients).
      </p>
      <p>
        I helped the founder launch a peak performance online course: video shooting and editing
        on Premiere Pro (200+ videos produced) & web implementation.
      </p>
      <h3>Phase 1: research & analysis</h3>
      <p>
        The first phase of our work together was to do a competition and market analysis. I did
        a benchmark of existing websites to identify best practices and based on a script I wrote,
        we conducted interviews on a panel of users who had already experienced health and wellness
        services. The interviews allowed us to identity peopleâ€™s goals, behaviours and mental
        models about personal development courses. The conclusions were very insightful:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="arrow-bullet-point">
          Most participants started a course after recommendation by an acquaintance.
          Testimonials must take a central place.
        </li>
        <li class="arrow-bullet-point">
          They look for availability and proximity with the trainer. Keeping close contact is
          essential to them for guidance, accountability and motivation: the website has to offer
          an easy contact solution and building a community around the course would be an advantage
          as it gives confidence and enhance the service delivered.
        </li>
        <li class="arrow-bullet-point">
          Users need to see the tangible results they get out of the course via testimonials but
          not exclusively: getting to see or experience the course before purchase, giving a detailed
          overview of what is provided, giving a lifetime access and resources or tools so they
          can get back to it easily.
        </li>
        <li class="arrow-bullet-point">
          Video and short formats work the best for them. Also, it must be very flexible and
          convenient: self-paced, self-sufficient but providing additional resources for those
          who want to dig further, with visual aids and interaction triggers to maintain interest.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        According to those results, we decided to offer free ebooks with plenty of advice as
        a way to discover the service and the trainer and offer a satisfaction guarantee for the
        course, highlight testimonials on the website, provide the first chapter of the online
        course as a second, less expensive, less time-consuming product.
      </p>
      <h3>Phase 2: design</h3>
      <p>
        We first agreed on a website architecture and I sketched mockups for the website design
        and provided guidelines for the client to write the website content. I proofread and put
        together the free e-books on Figma. In parallel, we spent 3 days shooting all the online
        course videos which I edited (200+ videos in total) with an intro and outro, transition
        screens and visual clues for more interaction.
      </p>
      <h3>Phase 3: implementation</h3>
      <p>
        After reviewing 6-8 online course platforms, the client chose to subscribe to Kajabi. I
        then implemented the website pages and structure according to the mockups, helped write
        part of the content and designed all the needed visuals on Figma. I made sure the online
        course platform was consistent with the rest of the website and overall branding.
      </p>
      <h3>Phase 4: launch</h3>
      <p>
        The website and online course were launched in early October 2020. While it is still early
        to draw conclusions on the online course results, the number of opt-ins has improved
        since the previous website and the average opening rate of the monthly newsletter proves
        to be quite high (35%). The improved branding helps convert more B2B clients every month.
      </p>
      <h3>What I learned</h3>
      <p>
        As my first project in a consultant role, the most important lessons I took away from
        it were how to communicate and collaborate with a client and how to manage a project
        with different levels. Having a shared understanding of the goals and deliverables is
        a must to avoid any misunderstandings. For that, as the project went on, I learned to
        clearly detail the scope, nature and timeline of the deliverables.
