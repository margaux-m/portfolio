      <p>
        I did a UX single case study for a fictive airline called FlyUX, in the framework of my
        UX Design training with the UX Design Institute. It involved researching, designing and
        prototyping a website and mobile app.

      </p>
      <p>
        To complete the study, I conducted usability tests, produced affinity diagrams & customer
        journey maps and eventually delivered wireframes.

      <h3>The starting point</h3>
      <p>
        The aim of the study was to help a new airline company, FlyUX, design their website and
        mobile application. I focused on one primary use case for the study: the flight booking
        process.
      </p>
      <h3>The design process</h3>
      <p>1. Research</p>
      <p>
        In this UX case study, as we were starting from scratch, the first phase of the work was
        to conduct extensive research on the competition through usability testing, competition
        benchmark, online survey and heuristics evaluation. It enabled me to identify best practices,
        common user behaviours and pain points they can have when booking flights on airline
        websites and apps.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="arrow-bullet-point">
          After setting clear usability test objectives, I recruited users, prepared test scripts,
          facilitated and recorded usability test sessions for desktop and mobile. I used Screenflow
          and Reflector to record the tests.
        </li>
        <li class="arrow-bullet-point">
          I also conducted depth interviews to understand better the people’s goals when
          booking flights.
        </li>
        <li class="arrow-bullet-point">
          Doing a competitive benchmark and heuristics evaluation helped me see how well or
          badly different organisations tried solve the same problem.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>2. Analysis</p>
      <p>
        The second phase consisted in making sense of the research data and articulate the problems
        the software should be solving for users. I used triangulation to have a more accurate
        understanding. After jotting down all interesting points the research brought up, I
        grouped them during an affinity diagram session. From there, I made a customer journey
        map encapsulating each high level step when booking flights and documenting the goals,
        behaviors and pain points of users.
      </p>
      <p>
        What clearly came out is that the process of booking flights is quite painful for users,
        especially when picking fares and coming up to choosing the add-ons. You can have a close
        look at the customer journey map here.
      </p>
      <p>3. Design</p>
      <p>
        I next defined how the app should be structured and the high level flow for booking flights
        on the FlyUX website and mobile app while addressing all the issues highlighted in the
        customer journey map. I used Axure to make flow diagrams, all the way through to payment
        and confirmation.
      </p>
      <p>
        From there, I sketched a lot to define a navigation style for the apps and determine
        how the navigation would behave at different points through the flow. I also sketched
        screens and screen states depending on the user actions. I found sketching helped me
        clarify my thoughts through iteration, embody all what came out during research while
        taking into consideration design patterns.
      </p>

        <li class="arrow-bullet-point">
          Flow diagram for desktop
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>4. Prototyping</p>
      <p>
        In the last phase, I created medium-fidelity prototypes for the mobile app and website.
        For this, I used Sketch and InVision. I eventually put together a detailed set of wireframes
        for the developers who would eventually build the products.

      <h3>What I learned</h3>
      <p>
        Working on the FlyUX case study was a valuable experience to carry out a UX design process,
        delve into and hone UX tools and techniques, like usability testing, affinity diagrams,
        Sketch, Axure, InVision, etc. One of the major learned lessons is always assume you won’t
        get it right the first time and iterations will be needed. Facilitating usability tests
        was also a great experience. It was a good challenge to remain neutral and be careful of
        my language not to influence the behaviour and thought process of the users.
      </p>
      <h3>About the UX Diploma course</h3>
      <p>
        The course gave me a deep insight into UX: from user research all the way through to
        prototyping and wireframing. It improved my critical thinking and ability to question
        the need of every element of a user interface and feature of a product. Apart from learning
        about UX skills and tools, it also taught me the mindset required to create high quality
        software products.
