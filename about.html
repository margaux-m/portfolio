        <h2>
          Hi there, I’m Margaux. <br>
          I’m a full stack developer based in Brussels, with a strong affinity for UX design.
        </h2>
        <p>
          One thing to know about me is that I’m quite an introvert who is passionate about
          building things with code and paradoxically enough about people behaviour.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since I’m very young, I have always been interested in various topics. History, literature,
          sociology, geography, economics, languages, mathematics, general science… I couldn’t get my
          head around and venture in a specific path. I then decided to follow communications studies
          for the diversity they could provide, at the crossroads between society and business.
        </p>
        <p>
          Back then, there was that little voice inside drawing me towards web development but
          I thought "Nah, this is not for me, not something I can do, too complex plus I’m starting
          a fresh communications graduate. I’m much better off using my people skills and humanities
          background to a position."
        </p>
        <p>
          Until I could no longer dismiss it.
        </p>
        <p>
          After finishing my studies as a communications graduate, I began working as a communications
          officer for an association.
        </p>
        <p>
          There, my scope was quite broad: from digital marketing to graphic design or website management.
          At the time, I had the chance to coordinate a website development project with an agency and to
          create an intranet by teaching myself the essentials of CSS and HTML.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was an eye opener about my true interest in tech and web development. From my communications
          perspective, I eventually spent my spare time learning about UX Design. I quickly realized that
          my work approach was very much aligned with design thinking and understanding where the real
          problems lied before bringing a solution to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          It decided me to follow a UX Design course which I graduated from in December 2019.
        </p>

        <p>
          A couple of years later, I attended Le Wagon Brussels coding bootcamp late 2020 to fully
          explore my coding abilities. 10 hours every weekday for the next 2 months was learning,
          coding, building apps, working part of a team of new web devs like me. I loved it!
          Problem solving, logic, creativity, all very exciting!
        </p>
        <p>
          Design, like communications, very much rely on good listening and problem solving skills.
          In retrospective, this is not such a coincidence I started my journey with communications
          and now I am wishing to continue it with designing and building web apps. These
          disciplines put people at the heart of their processes, trying to make other people's
          lives easier, better, or at least to impact them in a positive way.
        </p>
        <p>
          With UX design and web development combined, I have now the opportunity to develop apps that
          can bring benefits and enjoyment.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am currently looking to contribute to a team where I can prove my web development & UX design
          skills while learning new ones. Feel free to connect!

      <p>
        Building apps beyond the constraints that can get in the way provide me with great joy.
        I also get massive enjoyment with playing sports, going beyond my own - thought - limits
        and bringing my share to any team success. I enjoy best when being able to link play
        effectively: assessing options, picking the best one, delivering with a good timing,
        enabling my teammates to get the best possible conditions to finish. Sports is a huge
        passion and I can spend hours practicing, watching, discussing about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apart from that, I am a Nantes woman with French-Spanish heritage. I am very fond about history,
      cultures and what they can teach use about the present.
