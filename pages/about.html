    <h1>About me</h1>
    <h2>I’m Margaux Mansanarez, <br>a full stack developer and UX designer based in Brussels.</h2>
    <p>
      My background at first is in communications. After finishing my studies at Audencia Nantes
      Business School as a Communications graduate, I began working as a communications officer
      for an association in Brussels.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, my scope was quite broad: from digital marketing to graphic design or website management.
      At the time, I had the chance to coordinate a website development project with an agency and to
      create an intranet by teaching myself the essentials of CSS and HTML.
    </p>
    <p>
      It really got me interested in web development, front-end and eventually UX Design. I quickly
      realized that my work approach was very much aligned with design thinking and understanding
      where the real problems lied before bringing a solution to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It decided me to follow a UX Design course online with the UX Design Institute and the Glasgow
      Caledonian University. I graduated in December 2019.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time, I had also started a positon in People Operations and Office management at a
      Brussels startup called Cowboy, but eventually realized I wanted to grow as a Tech professional.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then attended Le Wagon Brussels coding bootcamp late 2020 to fully explore my coding abilities.
      10 hours every weekday for the next 2 months was learning, coding, building apps, working part
      of a team of new web devs like me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Design, like communications, very much rely on good listening and problem solving skills.
      This is not such a coincidence I started my journey with communications and now I am wishing
      to continue it with design. Both disciplines put people at the heart of their process, trying
      to make other’s people lives easier, better, or at least to impact them in a positive way.
    </p>
    <p>
      With UX design and web development combined, I have now the opportunity to develop apps that
      can bring benefits and enjoyment.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am currently looking to contribute to a team where I can prove my web development & UX design
      skills while learning new ones. Feel free to connect to discuss any work opportunity.</p>
